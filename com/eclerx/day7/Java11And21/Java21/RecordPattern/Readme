 Record Pattern Matching
Record patterns allow decomposing records directly into their components in switch expressions or if statements, making it easier to extract and work with individual fields.


Explanation Of Code

Creating Records:
We define two records:
Point: Represents a 2D point with x and y coordinates.
Rectangle: Represents a rectangle defined by two points (topLeft and bottomRight).

Using Record Patterns in switch:
In processPoint(), the switch statement decomposes the Point object into its x and y fields using record patterns.
We use a when clause to check if the point lies on the diagonal (i.e., x == y).


Using Record Patterns for Rectangle:
In calculateArea(), the switch statement extracts the coordinates from the Rectangle object.
It calculates the area using the decomposed points.


Testing with Main Method:
We create two points and a rectangle using those points.
We call processPoint() to print point details and calculateArea() to compute the area of the rectangle.
