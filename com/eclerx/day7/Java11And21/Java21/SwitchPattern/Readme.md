Why Use Switch Patterns?
Cleaner Code: Eliminates if-else ladders and instanceof checks.
Type-Safe Matching: The compiler ensures all patterns are exhaustively matched when using sealed interfaces.
Concise and Readable: Decomposing records directly in the switch case makes the code easier to read and maintain.
